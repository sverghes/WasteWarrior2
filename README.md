## Installation
You can deploy to Vercel directly by [clicking here](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/alyssaxuu/ecosnap). 

**Important:** Make sure to update the environment variable for [NEXT_PUBLIC_MODEL_URL](https://github.com/alyssaxuu/ecosnap/blob/a9c7e7e1ec19f106db69abd6d66be558bd21445a/.env#L16) in the .env file, and set it to an absolute URL where you host the [model.json](https://github.com/alyssaxuu/ecosnap/tree/main/ml/models/efficient_net/10/predict) (make sure to include the other shard bin files alongside the JSON).


## The AI Model

### Data

The model is trained on medical waste classification examples from Theatre and Pathology departments, including:

- **Red Bag Waste**: Infectious/pathological waste, contaminated PPE
- **Yellow Bag Waste**: Clinical waste, pharmaceuticals, anatomical waste
- **Sharps Containers**: Needles, scalpels, broken glass, surgical instruments
- **Blue/White Bags**: Pharmaceutical waste, expired medications
- **Black Bags**: Non-hazardous waste, general refuse
- **Chemotherapy Waste**: Purple/yellow bags for cytotoxic materials
- **Pathology Specimens**: Tissue samples, body parts, laboratory waste

Training data can be found in `ml/medical_waste_categories` combining healthcare facility datasets and images from Theatre and Pathology departments across NHS trusts.

### Training

The final model was trained using [TensorFlow's EfficientNet](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/applications/efficientnet_v2/EfficientNetV2B0) implementation, with model weights frozen for transfer learning to learn medical waste categories faster. The model was trained in `Python` on a GPU-powered machine for faster training. You can find the training script in `ml/train_medical.py` where different meta architectures and parameters were experimented with for optimal medical waste classification.

### Prediction

To predict the medical waste category, the model integrates with the front-end app for real-time results. We converted the model for compatibility with [TensorFlow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js) and used [Web Workers](https://github.com/alyssaxuu/ecosnap/blob/main/components/Worker.js) to prevent blocking the main thread during client-side prediction.

The app processes the image Tensor through the model, which returns probabilities for each medical waste category. The highest probability category is displayed with:

- **Disposal Protocol**: Step-by-step disposal instructions
- **Safety Requirements**: PPE and handling guidelines  
- **Regulatory Compliance**: NHS/healthcare facility requirements
- **Risk Assessment**: Contamination and safety warnings
- **Gamification Points**: Earned for correct identification

### Feedback

Medical waste classification accuracy is critical for patient and staff safety. When the model makes incorrect predictions, users can provide corrections, which benefits the system in several ways:

1. Healthcare professionals get accurate disposal information they need
2. We can monitor model performance in clinical environments
3. We collect new training data (with user consent) to improve the model
4. Users earn gamification points for providing feedback and teaching the system

The feedback loop includes:
- **Immediate correction rewards**: Bonus points for helping improve the model
- **Peer validation**: Other staff can confirm corrections for additional points
- **Learning analytics**: Track which waste types are most challenging for staff
- **Continuous improvement**: Model updates based on real-world Theatre/Pathology usage

While we implemented the front-end feedback system with gamification elements, the backend connection can be configured based on your healthcare facility's data governance requirements and privacy policies.
